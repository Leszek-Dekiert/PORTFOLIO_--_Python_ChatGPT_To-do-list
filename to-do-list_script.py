To-do list simulator

Description of the program: "To-do list simulator" is a program for writing
down notes, and assingnig a level of importance (or priority) to those
notes. The program also allowes to viewing the list (with priorities and
dates of entry), changing entries and/or priority levels, removing entries
and sorting entries by level of importance. Every time an entry is removed
it is being transferred to the archive file "To-do-list_archive". Enjoy.
